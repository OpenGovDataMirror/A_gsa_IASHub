Functional End-to-End (E2E) testing is conducted to ensure all requirements are met and the application is business ready.   

## Reference
* N/A

## Guideline
* Create documentation defining all steps to complete functional E2E testing.
* Test with all profiles and permission sets for a particular app, not just with developer admin rights.
* Functional tests should include testing the net new or changed features but should also include robust testing of existing features (regression testing).
* Functional tests can and should be in line with Apex unit tests, to help automate functional issues and detect them early.


## Requirement
* Conduct functional E2E testing in the integration sandbox.
