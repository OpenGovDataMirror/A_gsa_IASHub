This document is intended to provide instructions for navigating functional areas and completing processes within a specific Salesforce application. This document may be used by support staff or end users as a reference guide, and may serve as a foundation for training materials or a training supplement.

## Reference
* Click Path Template: http://goo.gl/Rc6emp

## Guideline
* The Click Path Document should include all major functional areas of the specific Salesforce application, and should be sectioned in a logical manner.
* The Development Team should assume the audience for the Click Path Document has a basic understanding of Salesforce functionality, and should not include Salesforce 101 concepts.
* Processes should be outlined primarily using text, and should adhere strictly to the formatting guidelines specified in the Click Path template.
* Screenshots are to be used only where text is insufficient in depicting more visual components of the application, but should generally be kept to a minimum to ease the burden of maintaining this document.

## Requirement
* Every new application or major release must be accompanied by a Click Path document - either new or updated.
* Updates to the Click Path document (beyond initial release) must include Release Notes within the documentâ€™s Revision History.
