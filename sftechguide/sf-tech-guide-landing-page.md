This document provides the Salesforce.com technical guidelines followed at GSA and expected of any team developing applications or enhancements for deployment on GSA’s Salesforce orgs. This document also includes tips and areas for additional consideration during application development.  This document consolidates best practices and requirements from real-life experience in GSA’s Salesforce and Force.com implementations.  The reader of this document is assumed to be familiar with the force.com platform and with force.com development.

Each content block within this document, aside from having an optional introduction is divided into the following sections:

- Reference - This document is not a beginner’s guide to force.com development.  It is assumed that the reader of this document understands how Salesforce and force.com work, as well as how to implement.  However, the reference section may provide links and resources that the reader can reference to refresh his or her knowledge.
- Guideline - Items listed under this section are rules that detail the general principles by which implementation is done at GSA.  These practices should be followed wherever possible and are enforced by GSA’s Solution Architects; planned deviations should be discussed with GSA’s Solution Architects in advance.  Failure to adhere to these guidelines may result in delays or rework.
- 	Requirement - Items listed under this section are essentially inviolable, and failing to adhere to them will likely result in the application being pulled from production or halted before or during development. 
-  (Optional) XXX Org-specific Details - This section (or sections)  is optional but may be included to provide additional best practices or requirements that apply to one or more Orgs specifically (but do not apply to others).  “XXX” is substituted with the Org name.
