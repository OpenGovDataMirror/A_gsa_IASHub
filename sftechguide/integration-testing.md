2.2 INTEGRATION TESTING

Integration testing is used to ensure all downstream and upstream applications and systems are functional and operating as intended, and allows for testing of code across multiple developers and teams.  

## Reference
* N/A

## Guideline
* Create documentation defining all steps to complete functional integration testing.
* Test with all profiles and permission sets for a particular app, not just with developer admin rights.
* Tests should include creation of new data as well as tests that include existing data.

## Requirement
* Conduct integration testing in the integration sandbox.
